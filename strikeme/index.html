            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>
                I don't ghostwrite<br>
Not a poltergeist<br>
But what am I supposed to write<br>
When I hold the mic<br>
You'll see my face<br>
On a CD case<br>
This is not a phrase<br>
That seems to make<br>
No sense, like if a bulimic ate<br>
And kept it down, so we could say<br>
I'll make you eat my words, like a piece of steak<br>
You want a piece of me?<br>
I'm an evil snake<br>
Watch the wordplay<br>
I'll be the king of the game<br>
You see what I'm saying<br>
I will impress people today<br>
Just leave it to me<br>
Like you were writing your will<br>
I'll never leave the mic cause I'm hyper in skill<br>
Win ciphers and kill every beat I come across<br>
Flaming me, it'll end in utter loss<br>
Like cows with no tits<br>
Drop a song, post it<br>
Listen to it, you'll be like<br>
"Oh shit, who wrote this?"<br>
<br>
Strike me<br>
Strike me<br>
Strike me<br>
Strike- Strike- Strike me<br>
Strike me<br>
Strike me<br>
Strike me<br>
<br>
Broke apart a friend group to foster a relationship<br>
Now you got no one to fall back on in case you split<br>
Burning bridges, look how this person's living<br>
You're mad at me 'cause I'm writing disses cursing scribbling<br>
All these livid critics, we going back to that?<br>
Already did that song, already mastered that<br>
That's a fact, I'm like Das Efx<br>
Try to watch your back, I'll go at your neck<br>
I'll pull a rhyme out of thin air<br>
They call me a rap machine<br>
I am a Sinclair<br>
I murdered the verse<br>
It's lying so still there<br>
Why are you still there<br>
Get swept off your feet<br>
Intentionally<br>
The things I say and do are detrimental to me<br>
I don't care what people say or what they mention to me<br>
I don't mouth off, that's what I led you to think<br>
But I got shit to say about everything<br>
It's not a parody if you only use the beat yeah<br>
You look tired, you look cozy, you asleep yet?<br>
Am I boring you?  How about I leak it?<br>
<br>
She said she don't love me no more, that's lovely<br>
She must be something of a cheater herself<br>
<br>
I'll never go to jail, never end up in prison<br>
Trap beat running for several minutes<br>
I'm incredible with it<br>
The way I leverage syllables<br>
No one better to spit it<br>
I'm incredible with it<br>
We ain't friends<br>
Two-faced kids, you're fake friends<br>
To make ends, I gotta cut you out<br>
That make sense?<br>
I'll say it blatant<br>
Out there, unexpected<br>
And I couldn't give a shit who my words affected
