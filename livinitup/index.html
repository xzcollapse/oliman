            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>All these livid critics<br>
They takin pisses inhibitin<br>
My winning rhythm with a fib<br>
How do they frickin live with this<br>
I'm flippin spittin shit<br>
They tell me I need Ritalin<br>
They speak to me in riddles<br>
But that shit don't hit a little bit<br>
Livin it up and I'm rhyming stuff<br>
But you're still stuck on that last verse<br>
Proud of words that you made up<br>
I've been tryin to get my game up<br>
The reason I'm livin is cause I'm ridin on insane luck<br>
Soon I'll be the billionaire, buyin businesses<br>
I'll be breakin banks, blastin bass, you'll all be witnesses<br>
I'll be flyin so high you'll never catch me out of whack<br>
Imma be so rich with all the money I will stack<br>
Everybody sayin that I'll never be the best<br>
But Imma keep on workin and I'll never take a rest<br>
They askin me for money, but I don't take requests<br>
Imma flip it up and dazzle them and leave them in distress<br>
Just like Beastie Boys, I've been money making<br>
Although some of the money the government be taking<br>
I'll have my backyard made out of that pretty cash<br>
So much of that green made all the haters feel abash<br>
Making all that money, feeling kinda funny<br>
Got the money like I'm Elon, in this land of milk and honey<br>
Going all out, I'm gunnin<br>
Three piece, I'm stunnin<br>
When I see the green I'm beeline<br>
All that cash it come up running<br>
Diamond plated like I was mining at Y:11<br>
When I die I'll take all my money with me to heaven<br>
Oops I meant hell, I'll be in circle number seven<br>
I'll be freestylin and rockin with the demons and the devil<br>
Money peaks my interest, like Pinterest without the P<br>
Just the rest, you're into this, don't even have to hint at it<br>
My rhyming schemin syllabus, I'm killing it<br>
Don't worry about my money, I'll have millions<br>
You're witnessing me willing it<br>
