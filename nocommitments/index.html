            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>
                These kids are all haters<br>
They don't see the hard labor<br>
Do me a small favor<br>
Tell the media, call the papers<br>
Right now, I'm not tryna be what I have to be<br>
To hell with the system<br>
I'll live out my fantasies<br>
Can't you see<br>
It's written right there<br>
All this criticism<br>
Right, like I care<br>
It might tear you apart<br>
To hear shit about you<br>
But I just don't give a shit<br>
And I don't kid around too<br>
You wished for round two<br>
Now look where that got you<br>
I write my own life<br>
I'm not allowed to not choose<br>
I got shoes on my feet and that's great<br>
I'm no longer available<br>
Today's the last day<br>
Hold the line<br>
So I can finish writing it<br>
I might even like it so much that I fight with it<br>
Wait<br>
You don't spit like I spit<br>
You can't be like me<br>
See how I handle the mic and shit<br>
I'm not addicted to the meth or the Vicodin<br>
I came here to warn you, your life is in<br>
Imminent danger<br>
I been with a stranger<br>
She said she don't love me no more<br>
That's lovely<br>
[CENSORED]<br>
I can't freestyle my verse<br>
Or write my words, help<br>
First lemme tell you the secret to being cool<br>
Stop giving a shit what other people think of you<br>
Feel no embarrassment<br>
Scream from your larynxes<br>
It's real apparent when I speaking my narratives<br>
My parents did everything they could to raise me<br>
Now I chill writing rhymes in a room steady pacing<br>
Never learned the basics<br>
Skipped to the end<br>
A lot of people ask me if I'm sick<br>
It depends<br>
I'm lifting three pens<br>
But only writing with one<br>
I'm real passive<br>
I got a mic but no gun<br>
<br>
I'm going no commitments<br>
I broke my hit list<br>
Too many people<br>
Too many bones to pick with<br>
I hone my skills<br>
Looking at golden hills<br>
Having fun cause soon<br>
I'll be holding bills<br>
I'm going no commitments<br>
I broke my hit list<br>
Too many people<br>
Too many bones to pick with<br>
I hone my skills<br>
Looking at golden hills<br>
Having fun cause soon<br>
I'll be holding bills<br>
<br>
Going no commitments<br>
Let's go and witness<br>
A man who makes rap his only mission<br>
This whole division can't get past the fact<br>
That rap is my life it's my mastercraft<br>
You have to get back cause nothing's stopping me<br>
I heard the beat in the distance calling me<br>
There's no probability of losing the will in me<br>
To pillage and kill emcees with my wicked villainy<br>
Building abilities to spit it freely menacing<br>
I'll wreck it forever and never ever stop pedaling<br>
Incredibly reveling I won't let no one step on me<br>
Hot like a kettle competitively I'm heavenly<br>
My back is aching but I still won't stop<br>
I'll be doing music and my post-doc<br>
Cold hot slow quick<br>
Whatever way I'm going<br>
I'm never laying ghost shit<br>
You'll venerate my flowing<br>
I'll penetrate the floor with my sharp ass mind<br>
You wanna drink and drive, get in a car crash, fine<br>
You will not catch my ass hitting the pills<br>
I use rap to cope, with all this shit that I spill<br>
Can I get Eminem to do a feature with me?<br>
Nah get your ass out dawg, we need you to leave<br>
I'm scheming to be the best me, the sweetest emcee<br>
Imma be loaded with cash and the keys to a G<br>
Deleting the weak<br>
Leave it to me<br>
I mean what I speak<br>
My verse is explosive, I blow the beat up and leave<br>
You're hearing a beast<br>
Empirically<br>
You see what I mean<br>
You'll get the heebie jeebies from your teeth to your feet<br>
<br>
I'm going no commitments<br>
I broke my hit list<br>
Too many people<br>
Too many bones to pick with<br>
I hone my skills<br>
Looking at golden hills<br>
Having fun cause soon<br>
I'll be holding bills<br>
I'm going no commitments<br>
I broke my hit list<br>
Too many people<br>
Too many bones to pick with<br>
I hone my skills<br>
Looking at golden hills<br>
Having fun cause soon<br>
I'll be holding bills
