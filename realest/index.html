            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <p>
                Whew, this has been one hell of a song to get out. I was initially going to scrap it, but eventually decided to release it (with minor backlash from the quality department). And then I had to cancel it due to said quality department deciding it wasn't representative of my creative values. After some small edits, I was able to pass it through and get it released, which will be happening on April 28. This song really came from the heart, and it took a lot of effort to produce. I hope you all enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it.

            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Oliman<br>
Look at him thinking he can rap, but he can't<br>
That's nice, I'll wear the red jacket and the blue pants<br>
Cause I couldn't care less what comes out of you man<br>
I'm lookin like a fruit stand, but I still rap better<br>
Instigatin me, tryna make me attack, never<br>
I'll never ever lose my temper<br>
[CENSORED]<br>
It caused me to stop and pick up the pencil<br>
Rappin saved my life, now it's a danger to yours<br>
The beat's infectin you like it was made up of spores<br>
I show no remorse on the outside<br>
But inside that boy ain't right<br>
Wanna fight? I'll out rap you in broad daylight<br>
I don't care if I'm not critically acclaimed<br>
To me it's all the same<br>
I don't do it for the fame<br>
I rap cause I wanna<br>
I spit harder than all the other fake products<br>
Claimin that Pac brought em up<br>
<br>
I released a song, I was cool for a day<br>
Everybody told me that I blew them away<br>
But the truth is I was never suited for appraise<br>
I suck at rapping, I'm just a student of the greats<br>
Sayin kudos to my face, they've heard my track<br>
But they don't give it second thought when they turn their backs<br>
It tells me in a way that my work is crap<br>
No one cares, they just see me as a worthless hack<br>
I wanna write a song with emotion<br>
I wanna touch people's hearts, at least that's what I'm hopin<br>
This came from the notebook that I wrote in<br>
Oh shit, why do all these broke kids think I'm jokin<br>
<br>
I wanna rap my emotions<br>
That might show them<br>
The great weight that lay<br>
On my back and shoulders<br>
You got it backwards<br>
I'm the greatest showman<br>
You don't care for talent?<br>
Fine! Go then!<br>
I'm holdin back<br>
This ain't even the real me<br>
Weaponizin words<br>
See what I'm wielding<br>
I'm beatin your lyrics<br>
You see it empirically<br>
I never hear it but I'm the realest<br>
You feel me?<br>
