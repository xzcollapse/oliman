            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>
                Killer on the mic, you could say I Run The Jewels<br/>
Harder than the people who rushed the Louvre<br/>
Dirty beats, get down and bust a move<br/>
I'm bored of life, I don't got enough to do<br/>
So I'll make it to the top, take over the world<br/>
Playing people songs until they know all the words<br/>
I'll say to all the girls and boys who heard the noise<br/>
Listen, look at where this person's going<br/>
Making all this music from basically nothing<br/>
So why you looking at me like I'm crazy or something<br/>
Pretty soon I'll break a record, make me some money<br/>
I say what's on my mind, you either hate me or love me<br/>
They gave me some appraisal but they hate my becoming<br/>
They say I'm stale and overrated but they play me, they want me<br/>
I'm crazy and hungry but praying for nothing<br/>
No Maybelline on me, I'm crazy, I'm crazy<br/>
<br/>
Learning the ropes, 16 but I'll make it<br/>
You can't get nothing on me, I ain't a racist<br/>
Antisemitic or misogynist<br/>
But that don't mean I haven't lost some friends<br/>
Don't let the hate break you<br/>
Take it and use it, let the hate shape you<br/>
Develop a Teflon surface, deflect<br/>
Don't let it all stick, don't purge your respect<br/>
You can reach for the stars all you want<br/>
But if you don't build a rocket you can't make it Mars<br/>
God helps those who help themselves<br/>
You know what?  Rebel!  Get up and raise hell<br/>
Pick it up, bring it here<br/>
With the lust, with the fear<br/>
Spit your words so hard that you'll shred the veneer<br/>
Of everyone here, you're unstoppable<br/>
On top of the world, doing the impossible<br/> 
<br/>
Venomous rhyme analyst<br/>
Never smoking the cannabis <br/>
Don't care if I never have a hand in it or I can't impress<br/>
So laugh at this anti-pacifist with a lack of sense<br/>
But still academically inclined, my mind's a labyrinth <br/>
The randomest thought comes to mind<br/>
Like how can I rap if I can't rap about crime<br/>
Or 9s or shooting five guys in a line<br/>
Every minute they prohibit spitting criminal shit<br/>
I get livid a bit, get up, get mad and scary<br/>
I really gotta try to extend my vocabulary<br/>
There's no magic to it, I just gotta hit the books<br/>
Then spit fire and split and then all the kids are shook<br/>
Then disappear like Christopher Hook <br/>
I'm never a crook, but to hell with the books<br/>
Everyone look<br/>
My bars could not scan in the checkout line<br/>
Can't ever let the anger that's pent up rise<br/>
I'm a get-up guy, take punches and roll with it<br/>
But the punches channel into my fist and I bolster it<br/>
You can't get close to this, you'll get caught in the crossfire<br/>
There's lots of fire and chaos but the cops are tired<br/>
